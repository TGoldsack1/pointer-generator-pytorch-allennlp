\u201cThe use of a single 3D model (\u201csingle source of truth\u201d), based on a common framework, as the sole design reference for a product\u201d Similarly, Model Based Enterprise can be defined as: \u201cThe use of a 3D model as the sole reference for multiple manufacturing processes across a product\u2019s manufacturing cycle\u201d  Broadly speaking, Model Based Enterprise (MBE) is the use of a 3D geometry as the single  reference for the production of a part or assembly, Model Based Definition (MBD) is the use of a single 3D model as the design reference only", "That is, a model designed through MBD will be  annotated with all information required for manufacture, such as GD&T data and bills of  material", "In an MBE process, this model is passed between departments, suppliers and clients  without the necessity for traditional 2D paper drawings and may be used in processes such as  manufacturing and inspection", "This comes with a multitude of potential advantages, including facilitating the improvement of  production rate, providing a more intuitive interface for end users, and providing a more  reliable and robust method for the storage of inspection data", "However, there are also a  number of limitations, such as software functionality, difficulties in incorporating legacy  products and overcoming resistance to change from end users and supply chains", "The academic literature around the subject demonstrates various methods for the  implementation of frameworks and how to implement a general MBE approach", "It also indicates that there are clear financial benefits to the implementation of MBE, and that industry either  uses or is generally receptive to its use", "This report presents an extension of this work by surveying the AMRC\u2019s partner companies to  understand their perceptions of MBD, specifically", "Quality improvement and better presentation of data were seen as key benefits, while current software capability and associated upskilling  were identified as problems to overcome", "The respondents also provided their own definitions,  and analysis of these reinforced the view that the storage of data in a single model is the key  feature of MBD", "Finally a demonstrator was developed to show an application of an MBE-based approach for an  inspection process, described within this report", "The demonstrator consisted of a KUKA iiwa  fitted with a camera, this being used to inspect the hole geometry of some motor retention  brackets", "This inspection information was attached to the 3D model of the brackets, along with  various other types of data to provide a reference for other potential processes", "Document Revision Page IMG036172 Draft 01 3 of 51 Confidential", "Copyright \u00a9 The

model as sole reference for all design  data for a component or assembly", "This can be extended by Model Based Enterprise (MBE),  which is the use of a digital model as the sole reference for all stages across the manufacturing process", "The use of these techniques has the potential for delivering cost, quality and time  savings into a manufacturing process, but their use is not pervasive within the Engineering  community", "1 Project overview This CATAPULT project was initiated to allow the AMRC to develop a more robust understanding of MBD and MBE, what benefits these can deliver to industry, and how these potential benefits  can be realised by both top tier companies and their supply chain", "The project also identified  areas where development is required in the practical implementation of MBD and MBE  approaches, and specifically explored the current state of the implementation of MBD within  industry", "Finally, it delivered a practical demonstration of a MBE process", "2 Report objectives This report is intended to be one of the two main deliverables of the project, alongside the  demonstrator described in section", "It has three main objectives: \uf0b7 Provide a high-level overview of the principles behind MBD and MBE, its potential  advantages and barriers to implementation, and current academic and industrial  practice around it \uf0b7 Provide an indication of current attitudes from industrial partners to MBD and MBE, and use this to suggest practical steps for the implementation of such approaches \uf0b7 Describe the demonstrator developed to showcase the MBE approach to manufacturing Document Revision Page IMG036172 Draft 01 7 of 51 Confidential", "Copyright \u00a9 The University of Sheffield / Apr-21 AMRC", "Template detail: AMRC", "RP

methodology that utilises the 3D CAD model  of the product as the sole design reference", "This differs from the common method of using 2D  drawings as the primary source of information about a product, with supplemental 3D models  being used for design and development work", "The goal of this approach is to reduce the  amount of superfluous documents and drawings, improve the consistency of the data used,  and to enable better virtualization of a product or process", "However, it does not necessarily  remove traditional 2D drawings from the design process if they are the most suitable  presentation format of the product information \u2013 it simply removes them as the primary source  of information", "Figure   2", "1 shows the conversion from a traditional 2D drawing as a source of information to a 3D model", "The same information is retained in the model but is better presented, with only  relevant information shown to the user via an interactive 3D PDF", "The most obvious benefit to  this is the intuitive viewing and presentation of the model, with this having clear applications in the generation of digital work instructions", "However, the key benefit to the storage of data in a  single model is that there is the potential for a significant decrease in product manufacturing  time, arising as a result of fewer conflicts between design changes", "This leads to faster analysis and approval of any changes, more intuitive instructions during manufacture and the potential  for two way data exchange being used to make in-process improvements", "Figure 2", "1 - A traditional 2D drawing (L) and the corresponding model displayed in an interactive 3D PDF (R) An MBD-based methodology broadly consists of annotating a 3D model with any information  relevant to the manufacture of the product", "Known as PMI (Product Manufacturing Information)  this can consist of any of the traditional information stored in a 2D drawing, such as  dimensions, tolerances and material", "This is related to the Common Information Model, which is a model that contains information relevant to all stages of the product\u2019s manufacturing process (i", "e", "design, manufacture and inspection)", "There are a number of factors to consider during the  definition of the Common Information Model and PMI, with these being listed below [1]: \uf0b7 Required contents - At the most fundamental level, it is important to consider what  details are necessary to transmit sufficient manufacturing information in a 3D CAD model \uf0b7 GD & T information - To enable the manufacture of a component it is important that the  model contains adequate tolerances, dimensions and other geometric definitions Document Revision Page IMG036172 Draft 01 8 of 51 Confidential",

Relevant information - Information stored in the model should be strictly relevant to the  process \uf0b7 Basic characteristics - The model must conform with the standards for the organisation  implementing an MBD approach, such as naming conventions, base coordinate systems,  notes etc", "\uf0b7 Security - The implementation of an MBD approach must not generate any process  security flaws \uf0b7 Standardization - Product meta-data should be standardized across an organisation if  possible as this allows interaction between various company systems (ERP, MES, CRM  etc", ") \uf0b7 Singular file data - All data should be kept in a single file, allowing easier access to all  users, and reducing manually reproduced data An MBD approach is defined using a framework, which describes how information (e", "g", "tolerances and dimensions) flows through a manufacturing process", "Frameworks are used in  the development of tools for accessing and acting on this information", "They are informed  through the analysis of workflows, which describe specific areas of work within a manufacturing process", "2 Model Based Enterprise Model Based Enterprise (MBE) extends the MBD methodology from a process or product to the  entire workflow of an organisation, using the 3D model generated as a single source of truth to  which relevant data is appended", "As such, the model may be used as a common reference for  processes including design, manufacturing, inspection, marketing and any other processes that may require product engagement", "The utilisation of common product models for the definition, execution, control and  management of enterprise wide operations can lead to the reduction of time and cost of the  development and delivery of that product", "Some industry leaders have estimated that MBE  could reduce costs by up to 50% and reduce time to market by 45%, however, they do go on to state that these goals are aggressive and would require significant investment to be achieved [2]", "The benefits delivered by an MBE approach may also better facilitate the incorporation of  modelling and validation techniques into the design and analysis process", "3 Benefits and limitations MBD and MBE deliver similar benefits and suffer from similar limitations, which are described in this section", "However, it is clear that the benefits would be most pronounced where both  approaches are used in tandem", "Given its reliance on the \u2018digital thread\u2019 \u2013 that is, the digital  linkage of all production processes \u2013 it is clear that MBE is reliant on an MBD implementation to deliver improvements to the manufacturing process", "1 Benefits The primary advantages to MBD and MBE are derived from the transition to a paperless  system, as the model itself contains all the information required for the manufacturing process", "The advantages can be summarised as so [3]: \uf0b7 Most companies use a mix of 3D CAD and technical drawings - MBD approach eliminates  conflicts between these", "Document Revision Page IMG036172 Draft 01 9 of 51 Confidential", "Copyright \u00a9 The University of Sheffield / Apr-21 AMRC", "Template detail: AMRC", "RP

Ensures that all end users of the model data have the same up-to-date information at all  times, reducing the likelihood of obsolete data being used for any part of the  manufacturing process", "2 Limitations Despite MBD having the potential to deliver significant benefits, as detailed in the previous  section, there are also a number of barriers to its implementation", "Recurring concerns that  arise across a number of sources are: \uf0b7 A large variety of users, ranging from design teams to technicians to sales teams, may  need access to the model and methods for each of these to access must be carefully  considered so that they deliver functionality while remaining intuitive  \uf0b7 Software updates or discrepancies between software in their application of the standards  could lead to incompatibility issues between models", "\uf0b7 Other companies in the supply chain may provide or require 2D drawings as part of any  contractual agreement, eliminating some time savings", "\uf0b7 Resistance to change from operators with engrained working methods means that effort  needs to be put into staff re-training and familiarisation with the MBD/E process", "\uf0b7 A consistent MBD/E framework must be adhered to at all times to ensure that the model  is always properly represented 2", "4 Distinction to other \u2018Model Based\u2019 approaches MBD and MBE are used as acronyms throughout this report for \u2018Model Based Definition\u2019 and  \u2018Model Based Enterprise\u2019, as described", "However, a number of other acronyms exist within a  similar sphere and are identical or similar to these", "The two frequently encountered are: \uf0b7 Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) \u2013 The use of domain models to exchange  information, in a manner similar to that defined by Model Based Enterprise", "\uf0b7 Model Based Design, Model Based Engineering (MBD, MBE) \u2013 The systematic use  of computational models to deliver time and cost savings during the design and test  phase of product development", "While the above are broad definitions, they are by no means the exclusive definition, and  features of one definition are not necessarily exclusive to that

commonplace within the Engineering industry as a whole, they are well-established in some sectors, such aerospace and automotive", "Even within these sectors,  however, their adoption is not universal, likely for a number of reasons", "This section details  current practice in terms of standards and software", "It also provides a review of the current literature around Model Based Definition", "MBD formed  the focus of this literature review as it allowed a more focussed approach to the work than  would have been possible with MBE \u2013 a literature review featuring MBE would have been too  broad to draw useful conclusions", "By specifically investigating MBD, it is likely that any  developments identified would be transferred to the wider manufacturing process, including if  a full MBE approach was utilised", "1 Standards A number of standards exist that describe the use of digital methods to represent technical  drawing data, with both the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and the  American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) providing standards", "These standards  expand on the established drawing standards (i", "e", "BS 8888 and ASME Y14", "100, Y14", "24 etc", ") to  dictate the requirements for such drawings to be represented using digital methods", "ISO 10303-242 is the standard for product data and exchange in a 3D model-based  manufacturing environment, and defines the STEP 242 file", "It has a broad scope, covering most aspects of design and manufacturing, but generally describes how to generate a part such that  it is usable in MBD architectures", "This is complemented by standards such as ISO 1101 and  ASME Y14", "41, which describe the specification for geometric tolerancing", "Further standards have been developed that are specific to given applications, a prime  application being MIL-STD-31000B, which is a document from the US Department of Defence  stating their interpretation of the standards with respect to the generation of technical data  packages", "QIF (Quality Information Framework) is an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)  standard for the transmission of PMI, with a focus on the inspection stage of the manufacturing  process", "To that end, it is designed to receive CAD in a native format, STEP 242 format or the  QIF MBD format", "It then defines rules for the presentation of measurement plans, rules, results, statistics and other parameters relevant to the quality process, with its XML format providing  the flexibility required for storing inspection data", "This section is not intended to provide an in-depth overview of these standards as the  standards that apply to given situations can vary, but rather flags their existence as a starting  point for understanding the standards required for the implementation of a manufacturing  process based on MBD", "2 Software A number of software packages exist to facilitate the implementation of MBD and MBE", "These  are either established CAD packages that include MBD functionality, or third party software  that delivers MBD capabilities using pre-existing software", "Key examples include: \uf0b7

"0 Furthermore, some offline programming and other software packages that rely on CAD data  but don\u2019t necessarily generate it (e", "g", "Mastercam) have been designed to work in an MBD  environment", "These programs preserve all data in a model provided that it has been generated in the appropriate format", "Most software packages have broadly similar functionality [4]", "However, there are some  notable exceptions", "For example, most packages output data conforming with the STEP 242  standard, although a few (such as the Siemens NX MBD plug-in discussed above) output in the  ANSI QIF standard", "In terms of implementation this standard should deliver comparable results  to STEP 242, but there may be problems related to interoperability where more than one  software package is used", "This highlights the necessity for careful consideration of process  requirements prior to the selection of any software to be used for Model Based Definition", "While some operate as standalone programs, most are extensions to existing CAD packages,  and the selection of the appropriate MBD software is therefore more likely to be driven by  existing process requirements than individual package functionality", "3 Literature review A limited amount of research exists, supported by anecdotal evidence, that the majority of  companies rely wholly or partly on 2D drawings as part of their principle source of design  information [1]", "Although only a small sample population was used, the results from this survey indicated that transferring data between the supply chain was an important hindrance in the  uptake of MBD, and a common information model between companies would provide a better  scope for uptake of MBD", "A survey by Tech Clarity has shown that interest in the uptake of an MBD is very high [5], with  reasons for its implementation including potential time savings, reduction of paper wastage,  efficiency gains and improvements in the lines of communication with the supply chain", "However, a number of blockers were identified with many respondents to the survey stating  that resistance to change was a significant issue, coupled with the requirement for training", "This highlights the necessity for accessible and intuitive methods for the implementation of  MBD", "Concerns about hardware and the wider supply chain\u2019s adoption of MBD also highlighted  issues", "Nevertheless, the majority of respondents that had implemented an MBD approach  reported some benefits to their company", "The attitude to an MBD approach within specific aerospace companies is discussed in [3]", "While the companies acknowledge the potential benefits of using MBD and the paper clearly indicates that the transition of design data to a single 3D source is possible, doubts remain about the  long-term implications of storing data in the form of 3D models, particularly with regards to  software compatibility and storage issues", "A caveat here is that these responses were provided in 2010 - MBD has developed considerably since then, but the concerns in general remain valid for the aerospace industry", "Further to this, as MBD is very heavily software driven, the end user of the engineering  drawings needs to have the proper software tools at their disposal and need to be trained to  use it", "This leads to an increase of responsibility which can overstrain the users [4]", "Further, to  obtain the best value from MBD, designers require proper training in annotation to properly  utilise MBD [6]", "A study in 2016 used three typical manufacturing processes to show that the use of MBD could  generate a measurable and significant change in the overall time of the manufacturing  process, with this being less pronounced for the inspection phase [7]", "However, this paper  notes that inconsistent PMI can cancel out the benefits gained through the introduction, and it  Document Revision Page IMG036172 Draft 01 13 of 51

specific  requirements, but it is clear from previous work that the development of more intuitive \u2018end  user\u2019 tools may be useful for this purpose", "Results from basic trials in [9] show that, when using the standard STEP 242 format, MBD  models can be transferred between different CAD packages while retaining appropriate  accuracy", "While this indicates that passing data between CAD users can be software  independent (a feature useful where MBD is implemented in a complex supply chain, for  example), the results also demonstrate that careful selection of parameters is required when  doing so", "However, some evidence exists that suggests care must be taken when translating from CAD  to STEP 242, and then to a format suitable for CAM and CMM models, as a complete set of data  is not always transmitted [6]", "This should be averted through the use of specialist MBD  software, as discussed in section 3", "2, but otherwise indicates that careful validation of the  model is required following any translation", "This source also states that the QIF standard may  be more reliable than STEP 242 for transmitting PMI, particularly for the inspection process,  with an overview of QIF provided and its implementation in a metrology workflow discussed in Research also looks at the creation of a framework for incorporating inspection into the MBD  process without the use of QIF, by generating inspection instructions for Coordinate  Measurement Machines (CMMs) [11]", "The information from these routines can then be fed into  the model and visualised or used to inform future processes by adjusting future programs  accordingly, or running alternative automated processes depending on the inspection results", "MBD has also been shown to be useful during the engineering change process, with a tool  developed in [12] for propagating design changes to a part throughout a whole assembly, and  feeding back the effects of these changes to the user", "This tool was shown to reduce the time  taken to analyse the effects of any changes from half a day using traditional engineering  change management methods to approximately two hours for a sample assembly", "A successful attempt has been made to extend the MBD methodology to the digital twin to improve the  efficiency of the engineering change process, and to provide more intuitive data presentation 3", "1 Literature review summary The benefits of MBD have been demonstrated in specific processes and are recognised by  companies", "However, a variety of barriers remain, primarily related to the consistency of data  passed between processes and companies, resistance to change from operators and the  storage requirements over the long term", "Some of these issues, such as consistency of data,  are being addressed in the latest literature", "Based on the literature review, it is clear that there is little recent data about the current  industrial application of MBD in the United Kingdom, despite the existing information indicating  there is a disconnect between the desire to implement MBD processes and their uptake", "By  obtaining usage data, it may be possible to devise a strategy for developing the maturity of  Model Based Definition within industry", "Document Revision Page IMG036172 Draft 01 14 of 51 Confidential", "Copyright \u00a9 The University of Sheffield / Apr-21

to establish the state of Model Based Definition  within the engineering sector", "The objectives of this survey were to establish how MBD is  currently defined within industry such that the AMRC can align its research objectives, and to  identify areas where research potential into the implementation of MBD exists", "While the  survey was focussed on MBD, many of the questions were designed such that they could be of  use in the implementation of a manufacturing process utilising MBE", "1 Survey overview The survey questions were defined in a further AMRC document [14], and a copy of these is

brief summary of the  results, the conclusions drawn from the survey, and an overview of useful future work to  enable the implementation of a MBD/E approach", "The raw survey responses are not provided  for the sake of brevity, but are available in the appendix, section 7", "1 Results overview The survey received 18 responses overall, with 78% of these coming from the United Kingdom,  with 56% of those respondents working in aerospace", "44% of respondents were from  companies with less than 250 employees (i", "e", "SMEs), whilst 39% of responses were from  companies with more than 10,000 employees", "Although only 17% of responses came from  medium-sized companies, this may not reflect a lack of engagement, but simply be a reflection of the AMRC\u2019s membership base and wider efforts to engage SMEs", "Perceived understanding by the respondents was generally mixed, with engineers in aerospace companies being the most likely to state that they understood MBD", "It also appeared that the  level of understanding was consistent, irrespective of the size of the company", "Overall, just  over 40% of respondents felt that they understood MBD, while just under 40% felt that they  didn\u2019t, the rest having limited knowledge", "Asked about which CAD formats were used, the respondents identified STEP as being the most  common format, implying that the implementation of STEP  242 shouldn\u2019t be too onerous if a  suitable software package was available", "However, many respondents noted that they send  and receive design data in differing formats, with a common feature being the receipt of files in the STEP format and their despatch in a native format", "This final point has to be given careful  Document Revision Page IMG036172 Draft 01 15 of 51

potential advantages to  Model Based Definition, with the most popular response being that it provides a single source  of information - presumably, the respondents identified such a system as delivering significant  efficiency benefits", "However, other key advantages identified included reduction in design time as a result of using CAD as the sole reference, elimination of paper documents

benefit of MBD if the  supply chain does not adopt it, and are concerned about the investment required to achieve  MBD functionality in terms of software and training costs", "Cost is particularly relevant for  aerospace given the large number of legacy products and their associated storage  requirements, and this is reflected in the number of respondents who said number of legacy  products was their main concern, as a proportion of those who listed it as a general concern", "It is clear from this that there is work to do for software vendors to alleviate the concerns about compatibility,

interface", "One application was a Solidworks plugin that was capable of extracting PMI  information entered into the CAD model, and the other was an application to interface with the  inspection process, allowing the user to select what type of inspection they wished to perform", "Screenshots of these applications can be seen in Figure   5", "The Solidworks plugin utilised the Solidworks API to extract the Geometric Dimension and  Tolerance (GD&T) and any notes that were attached to the model", "The file outputted by the  plugin was a 3D PDF, a PDF that has 3D content such as models embedded within it", "An  example of a 3D PDF is provided in Figure   5", "The GD&T information was then utilised to  drive a number of operations", "Initially, the tolerance values for each of the parts of the model  that were to be inspected were extracted", "From these values, it was possible to determine the  appropriate pieces of equipment required to perform each inspection", "Figure 5",

Assessments, could then be attached to the 3D PDF", "This enabled the end user to have immediate access to the most up to date version of any documentation they  would require to perform any process

utilise the information regarding the required equipment to drive  Enterprise Resource Planning software", "Equipment Driving Licenses are documents that detail  who in the organisation is trained to use which pieces of equipment and to what level", "If this  information is stored in a matrix or a central, query-able database, it is possible to determine  which employees are trained to perform the different tasks", "Furthermore, if the schedules of  the required employees and the utilisation of the equipment are also accessible, it is possible  to then begin to plan resources, in terms of both employees and equipment, solely based off  the information contained within the CAD model", "As well as the relevant equipment documentation, notes attached to the CAD model can also  be extracted from the model, as well as any meta data the designer included in the model file", "The notes can contain any information ranging from assembly instructions to COSHH  requirements", "This enables a user to also have access to the any and all information regarding  any process of the part will undergo, all contained within a single file", "The second application was developed to act as a method of recording the results of both  manual and automated inspection processes, and generating an inspection report from these  results, which was attached to the 3D PDF", "This continues the MBD philosophy of having a  single file containing all the relevant information about a part, as each part had an individual  PDF for its instance", "Then, as before, if for any reason a person requires information about a  part e", "g", "what equipment was used to inspect the part, and the results of the inspection, the  user only needs to find one file to access that information rather than multiple files in one  location or possibly multiple files in multiple locations", "The application itself operated by identifying the most recently produced 3D PDF in a folder (or  an alternate file can be selected if required)", "The user then selected from a list of different  automated inspection processes related to that part", "On clicking \u2018Automated Inspection\u2019 the  process ran and prompted the user to attach it to the selected 3D PDF", "The GD&T information  extracted from the CAD model in the earlier application was used in the inspection process to  determine whether each inspected part had passed or failed the inspection", "This method of inspection is advantageous because if, for whatever reason, it is decided that  the required tolerance on the part changes, any 3D PDFs generated from that point on will  carry that information automatically through to the inspection processes with the only user  input required being an update to the GD&T information in the CAD

Backend control Two different methods were used for communicating between the National Instruments camera used for the inspection process and the Kuka Iiwa used to position the camera", "Due to the

commands via MQTT, and as an MQTT broker was being implemented for the  integration of the system into a Digital Twin, it was straightforward to use this to communicate  with the camera", "The

recommendations 6", "1 AMRC definition Given the information provided, Model Based Definition can be defined as: \u201cThe use of a single 3D model (\u201csingle source of truth\u201d), based on a common framework, as the sole design reference for a product\u201d Similarly, Model Based Enterprise can be defined as: \u201cThe use of a 3D model as the sole reference for multiple manufacturing processes across a product\u2019s manufacturing cycle\u201d  6", "2 Future development The choice of software can be user and application specific", "The development of a range of  software solutions that can read files generated through MBD would allow some flexibility to  organisations", "For example, a large company could implement different applications for its  design and marketing teams to access the same model, and functionality and presented  information could be customised accordingly", "This ties in well with the ethos of the digital thread, in that the provision of information via a  single 3D model allows easy and customisable access to the most up-to-date data", "Developing  a reliable system for presenting this to an operator would enable the introduction of digital  work instructions with up-to-date notes and inspection data, as well as information about  defects and the tolerancing state of previous parts in the assembly", "Many companies have not engaged with MBD as their sole source of manufacturing  information", "As such, some benefits are lost if information is passed between traditional  suppliers and those that have adopted MBD (or vice versa), as time must be spent converting  between 2D and 3D models", "One source suggests that companies tend to make their own 3D  models from 2D drawings, even if provided with models alongside the drawings, as the 2D  drawings tend to form the basis of any work contract [1]", "As such, the ability to pass a  consistent model between parties could deliver considerable time savings", "This highlights one  potential area where a clear best practice for the implementation of MBD across a supply chain could deliver significant time savings, as well as reducing the potential for errors during  drawing translation", "The incorporation of such a procedure would, however, need to be tied  into a method for the generation of a common framework such that information is not lost as a  model is passed between users", "It is clear that there is little understanding of the use of MBD across a range of industries", "While multiple surveys have been conducted to establish how and why MBD is and isn\u2019t used, these  have tended to be limited in scope and with a small population size", "While there is considerable research that examines perceived barriers to MBD integration, a better understanding of the  attitude of potential industrial users to the process would provide an indication of where  research should be focused to ensure that companies are able to take maximum advantage of  the potential benefits delivered MBD process", "3 Recommendations for short-term development The work suggested previously is an indication of where development work should be broadly  focused", "However, some more specific

augmented reality adoption as part of their assembly, verification, and testing processes", "At  Crown  House  Technologies,  a  datasheet  accompanies  each  manufacturing  assembly outlining  the  manufacturing  stages,  current  progress,  and  completion  timestamps", "Each assembly  must  undergo  various  factory  acceptance  tests  to  ensure  it  meets  the  relevant industry standards; the paper test results are added to the datasheet", "Augmented reality (AR) provides additional context and information to a user\u2019s view through various methods of light projection (the preceding trade study describes AR and the various delivery methods and tools)", "For augmented reality to deliver relevant information, data must first be captured, processed, stored, and retrieved", "Laing O\u2019Rourke currently do not have a central repository of data for each of the identified processes", "Therefore, a backend database for each testing process will be created to simulate a

schematic to accommodate plant rooms with one to  six  pumps", "The electric  panel  houses  both  the  electrical  supply  and the  electronic control for the pumps", "Once installed into the plant room module, the panel must be tested and comply with an electrical installation test (BS7671), electrical installation condition report, and a continuity test to ensure the panel has been correctly linked to the external units", "The tests occur during the factory acceptance testing, before the module is installed on-site", "For the pilot scheme, the continuity test was identified as the first process to adopt augmented reality", "Currently, the continuity test requires a qualified and highly skilled engineer with knowledge of the  panel\u2019s  design  and  schematics  to  conduct  the  test  efficiently", "Provided  alongside  the schematics is a table describing each cable\u2019s type and dimensions", "The engineer uses the schematics  to  identify  each cable  and  the  terminals  of  the  connected  components", "Paper documents are used to record test results, with each step completed based on the multimeter readouts and information gathered from the schematics and visual inspections (see Appendix, Error: Reference source not found)", "2 Process Analysis There are many inefficiencies inherent to paper based documentation: high risk of loss and damage, document legibility, repetitive data population, and manual data analysis", "Recording test results  digitally  can alleviate many of  these issues  [1]", "Digital  records  can be stored, shared, and copied across multiple devices and storage mediums, reducing the risk of loss and damage", "With digital records, previous records can be retrieved with ease, and data analysis software can provide valuable feedback and anomaly detection", "92%  of  the  continuity  test  sheet  can  be  populated  automatically  with  knowledge  of  the schematics, project, and module type", "Centralised storage mediums, such as servers, provide many advantages over local storage on individual computers", "Servers provide a single point of storage for all users on the same network", "This enables collaborative work and real-time access to the latest versions of documents and data", "Servers store unstructured data, such as CAD files and other large data structures, but can also store structured data in databases", "Project information, module type, and schematic data can be structured and stored in a relational database  [2]", "Query languages such as SQL retrieve associated information from a database using value matching", "With a relational database, it would be possible to locate all modules, module build status, test data, and associated CAD models for a project", "To populate the continuity test sheet with the correct information about an electric panel, the information  regarding  cable  and  component  specifications  and  connections  need  to  be extracted from the schematics into a relational database", "Due to the modular nature of the panel, there is a clear relationship between number of pumps and what cables and components are present", "With the panel schematics populated in a relational database, we can populate each cable test with its relevant specifications with a database lookup of the panel\u2019s model number", "Wirelessly connected

database", "Augmented reality requires information about the user\u2019s physical  surroundings to provide a contextual overlay", "This is captured through various sensors such as monocular and binocular cameras, IR depth cameras, and inertial measurement units (IMU)", "Post processing on sensor feedback helps to locate the user and identify objects in view", "With a virtual model of an object or environment and an understanding of the user\u2019s location, it is possible to align the digital world to the physical world, creating an overlay as seen in Error: Reference source not found", "An augmented overlay allows for object highlighting as seen in Figure 6", "Currently no CAD models of the electric panel exist, but one can be reverse engineered using a laser scanner and modelling software", "Most manufacturers of the components used inside the panel have freely available CAD models", "A digital model of the electric panel was created in 3DS Max by measuring the external dimensions of the panel, and overlaying a laser scan of the physical panel to precisely place the CAD models of the components, as seen in Figure 1", "Figure 1 High-density laser scan used as

reality into existing manufacturing processes at Crown House Technologies", "Laing O\u2019Rourke have identified two processes for the pilot scheme to demonstrate and quantify the benefits of augmented reality adoption as part of their assembly, verification, and testing processes", "At  Crown  House  Technologies,  a  datasheet  accompanies  each  manufacturing  assembly outlining  the  manufacturing  stages,  current  progress,  and  completion  timestamps", "Each assembly  must  undergo  various  factory  acceptance  tests  to  ensure  it  meets  the  relevant industry standards; the paper test results are added to the datasheet", "Augmented reality (AR) provides additional context and information to a user\u2019s view through various methods of light projection (the preceding trade study describes AR and the various delivery methods and tools)", "For augmented reality to deliver relevant information, data must first be captured, processed, stored, and retrieved", "Laing O\u2019Rourke currently do not have a central repository of data for each of the identified processes", "Therefore, a backend database for each testing process will be created to simulate a  centralised  repository", "The  method  of  data  capture,  processing,  and  storage  for  each database is discussed in the analysis section", "Data retrieval and the augmented reality delivery methods are discussed in the hardware and solution sections", "Document No State Revision Page IMG007886 Draft 1 7 of 40 Confidential", "\u00a9 2021 AMRC with Boeing", "Template \u2013 AMRC", "RP

schematic to accommodate plant rooms with one to  six  pumps", "The electric  panel  houses  both  the  electrical  supply  and the  electronic control for the pumps", "Once installed into the plant room module, the panel must be tested and comply with an electrical installation test (BS7671), electrical installation condition report, and a continuity test to ensure the panel has been correctly linked to the external units", "The tests occur during the factory acceptance testing, before the module is installed on-site", "For the pilot scheme, the continuity test was identified as the first process to adopt augmented reality", "Currently, the continuity test requires a qualified and highly skilled engineer with knowledge of the  panel\u2019s  design  and  schematics  to  conduct  the  test  efficiently", "Provided  alongside  the schematics is a table describing each cable\u2019s type and dimensions", "The engineer uses the schematics  to  identify  each cable  and  the  terminals  of  the  connected  components", "Paper documents are used to record test results, with each step completed based on the multimeter readouts and information gathered from the schematics and visual inspections (see Appendix, Error: Reference source not found)", "2 Process Analysis There are many inefficiencies inherent to paper based documentation: high risk of loss and damage, document legibility, repetitive data population, and manual data analysis", "Recording test results  digitally  can alleviate many of  these issues  [1]", "Digital  records  can be stored, shared, and copied across multiple devices and storage mediums, reducing the risk of loss and damage", "With digital records, previous records can be retrieved with ease, and data analysis software can provide valuable feedback and anomaly detection", "92%  of  the  continuity  test  sheet  can  be  populated  automatically  with  knowledge  of  the schematics, project, and module type", "Centralised storage

Introduction   Vision systems are used extensively in automation as a flexible form of metrology  and sensing, allowing a system to have a view of work akin to a human\u2019s view on a  task", "However solutions are often challenging to implement for several reasons, such  as variations in lighting, reflective nature of surfaces, and limitations placed by  camera accuracy and calibration", "To combat this, industrial vision software often comes with advanced built-in features  that allow a relatively inexperienced user to filter difficult camera feeds and images to  reliably make out features and perform a task (i", "e", "guide a robot, measure a part)", "This software is often designed to be used in tandem with industrial specification  cameras which are guaranteed to perform as specified and give a usable image for  inspecting", "These industrial systems provide a proven and reliable base, but at a high cost", "For  research projects, the cost of testing if a vision system is suitable for a purpose can  be prohibitively high", "Outside of vision systems, camera technology for general consumers has been  driven particularly rapidly to the point where many modern devices have high-spec  cameras with  high pixel counts developed at a low cost", "This has led to a great drive  in improving the quality and cost of digital camera systems, leading to high quality  and very low cost cameras being widely available", "Combined with this, many open- source vision solutions have been developed by programmers over recent years", "Open-source software is created under open-source licenses online by any  developers who want to take part", "This makes it free to use, and provides the entire  code base for modification if needed", "The purpose of this project was to determine if the recent drive in camera technology  paired with stable versions of open-source vision software could provide a decent  testing bed for vision systems and the find a way to grade the quality of these  systems against each other and the proven industrial equivalents", "Document No", "Revision No", "Page  ABG076\u2013AMRC\u2013RP\u2013140617A\u201301 01 6 of 27  5 Selection of Systems  There is a wide range of open source and commercial vision systems available on  the market", "Due to limited time and to ensure the project was kept in budget, a  limited number of open-source software packages and commercial-off-the-shelf  hardware had to be picked to look at in detail", "To  down select from the wider range  of choices, a review was conducted of available solutions", "The visible features, pros,  and cons were weighed up to decide what would represent the most useful solution  for the project", "1 Review of Open-source Software  Firstly, an overall search was undertaken to see what software could be found online  and what features were available, with the results collated for this review", "During this search, it became obvious that open-source

to give  the time taken some context", "It is worth noting that the Open Source systems will  naturally take more time and effort, as they are libraries while the 2 industrial systems  are already programmed into pre-made suites", "Cognex Intellect: Time Spent ~ 4 hours   The Cognex system has been used extensively by the AMRC for a variety of  inspections in the past, and therefore setup was relatively quick and hassle free", "For  a first time user the included documentation is extensive and the interface tools quick  to setup via a drag-drop interface", "More advanced inspections (such as altering the  advanced settings or adding a script for inspection) could prove more time  consuming without experience in using the system", "Due to the use of only one  specific piece of camera hardware a large layer of complexity, and therefore setup  time, present in the 3 other systems tested was removed", "Scorpion Vision: Time Spent ~ 8 hours   The Scorpion Vision software has also been used multiple times by the AMRC in  previous projects, so development time was shorter than it would be for an unfamiliar  user", "Setup time was increased from Cognex as the general interface was more  complex", "This was partially due to Scorpion Vision\u2019s use of multiple cameras during  testing and the related setup, and the variety of images that could possibly be  processed", "The built-in tools covered everything required without extra scripting,  which made the inspection setup quick once the initial setup was done", "The included  documentation was adequate and phone support was available when required", "OpenCV: Time Spent ~44 hours   Unlike the preceding two systems, the AMRC had to use OpenCV as a framework to  develop our own vision system software", "This lead to a longer development time as  the GUI and underlying code had to be created by the AMRC", "In addition, the AMRC  was unfamiliar with OpenCV so it had to be learnt from scratch", "The AMRC found the

process were much  easier than the OpenCV equivalent, making it simple to include in a C# WinForm  project", "This also enabled the AMRC to make the GUI much faster, thanks to  Microsoft Visual

strengths that would be useful in a variety of contexts", "The results show that open- source solutions can give good, and theoretically equal, accuracy results when  compared to industrial solutions", "They can also do this at a no up-front price", "However, they also have notable weaknesses compared to industrial solutions, since  they require considerable more time and effort to program, and don\u2019t offer the  guaranteed reliability industrial software does", "This project\u2019s results show a similar set of pros and cons regarding CotS camera  hardware", "The cameras tested that showed excellent performance-to-cost, were  better at colour imaging than most industrial cameras and offered very high pixel  density comparatively", "However, they were less accurate devices without  considerable effort applied to the image, required more tuning to match any given  industrial environment, and crucially lacked the ability to change lenses", "From these results, it appears that open-source vision systems offer a low-cost way  to test an advanced vision setup that would be very useful in low TRL research", "Open source software would be a good low cost way to experiment with new  methods not easily accomplished with existing on-the-market technology", "However,  using open-source software and CotS hardware greatly increased the effort required  in programming, which increases cost through man-hours", "Also open-source systems  lack the guaranteed 100% reliability and trust in measurements required for use in an  industrial shop-floor environment", "Within the context of the research done by the AMRC, both open-source and  industrial systems have viable uses depending on the TRL of the project", "Open- source software would be more viable if the work done in this project was extended  to remove the high effort barrier to get the software programmed and implemented", "Document No", "Revision No", "Page  ABG076\u2013AMRC\u2013RP\u2013140617A\u201301 01 27 of 27  10 Possible Future Work  There are several possible branches of work that could be done to extend this  project", "Firstly, both the open-source software coding and the testing procedure  developed could be used to create standards for future vision system creation within  the AMRC", "These standards could consist of coding standards to ensure vision code  is easily understood and cross-compatible across developers, and testing standards  to produce a fixed set of tests and metrics that could be used to determine the  suitability of vision systems to tasks before fully integrating them", "Secondly, the testing done in this project could be move onto more complex tasks  that aren\u2019t yet commonly used in industrial applications", "An example of this would be  stereo-vision, a relatively new technique that uses 2 camera feeds and software to  produce 3D inspection data on a scene or object", "Many of these more complex tasks  have become possible due to the rapid development of computer processing  capability; therefore they are at a lower TRL level and might be less well developed  in industrially approved systems, making open-source based solutions more viable", "Thirdly, the testing done could be extended over more cameras and possibly other  camera-related systems", "New sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect and the Leap are  not strictly vision systems, but often contain cameras in conjunction with other  sensors based on similar technology (such as a CMOS or CCD light sensor tuned to  pick up on infra-red light) to perform similar inspections", "This could also tie into the  previous point, as most of these sensors are based on adding 3D inspection  functionality without the complex and time consuming code required in stereo vision  systems", "Finally, if an open-source vision solution were to be used in an industrial test-bed, it  would need to be properly integrated into a machine", "Industrial vision systems have  this functionality, but it would need to be developed for the open-source derived  software", "Several network and communication systems exist for machines, and  developing a middleware that would be able to turn results from a low-cost camera  into a format that could be transmitted efficiently over the majority of these networks  would be a useful development for rapid testing and deployment of these systems in  the future"], "summary_lines": ["\u00a9AMC 2012\u00a9AMC 2013\u00a9AMC 2012", "\u00a9AMC 2012\u00a9AMC 2013\u00a9AMC

Revision 14 (June 2017)  Executive summary  The work performed for this report was developing a remote support system for physical assets and processes that  improved upon the current offerings in

 a part of a Doctorate Engineering program", "The system developed used mobile AR and VR technologies produced by  Google, Tango and Daydream respectively", "The Google Tango AR application allowed a highly detailed, 3D scan mesh of the physical asset to be produced, the  user could then place markers upon the scanned mesh to highlight regions of interest, annotations could be added to  give further detail into why the user believed that area to be an issue, and an image could be taken and also attached  to marker", "This information is then uploaded to an FTP server and a Mongo Database", "The supporter, using the  Daydream VR application, can then download the data and view the scanned mesh, look and interact with markers to  see the annotations and images attached", "The remote expert can also place their own markers and edit ones already  uploaded ones", "This is an improvement on current support offerings because it contextualises the problem for the support, rather  relying on the user being able to articulate their problem to the support in enough detail", "Instead the supporter can  virtually look at the whole product and any components that could be causing the issues, to determine the possible  cause of the issue and different possible solutions to the problem", "It is also a much more efficient use of expert\u2019s time,  instead of having to travel to

Remote Support is used across a wide range of different industries, for many different types of  products", "These services have typically operated in a similar fashion throughout their existence,  but recent advancements in a number of fields could potentially allow these services to finally  move forward and provide more accurate help", "1 Current Offerings    1", "1 Call Centres  Everybody has been there at one point or another, some kind of purchased product, for whatever reason, no longer  works, doesn\u2019t go together properly or is just simply broken", "The instruction manual has been consulted, which was  no use, Google returned no useful information and all troubleshooting methods have been exhausted to no avail;  there remains one option: Calling support", "There are a wide number of reasons why these services are less than ideal", "Firstly, they are almost always conducted  over the phone or via an internet chat system", "This is an issue because it relies on the user, whom is very rarely  knowledgeable about the product they are having problems with, being able to articulate the issue they are having  well enough so that the supporter can build a mental picture in their head of the scenario, determine likely causes and  solutions to the problems, and then feed this information back to the user for them to carry out the fixes", "Secondly,  these services are often outsourced to different countries, which can potentially affect the quality of the connection,  and it means that the supporter you are speaking to will probably not have the same first language as you, which  could potentially introduce language barriers to the situation", "Lastly, the item you are having trouble with could be  one of tens, hundred or maybe even thousands of items produced by that company, meaning that it is very unlikely  that the supporter will be an expert or have specialist knowledge about the particular product you are having  problems with", "2 Call outs  The alternative to calling a support line is to arrange a call out", "This is when the client and the company who produced  or supplied the product organise an appointment for an expert to come out to the client and fix the issues themselves", "While this is the most efficient method to fix the problem itself, as the expert can troubleshoot more effectively  potentially using specialised tools and software, it also has a number of fairly prominent drawbacks", "Call outs can be expensive for the supplier or producer as they are losing the productivity of an expert for a number of  hours, and in some cases they can also be expensive for the client as a charge may be incurred", "The number of experts  that a company will have available is limited, which means that the next available appointment slot could be the next  day or the next week", "This is time consuming for the client and could have prominent repercussions if, for example,  they are an SME and one of their main pieces of equipment is no longer functioning", "This means that for the duration  of the time spent waiting for the expert to come to them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to produce anything, so they will miss  order deadlines and this will have a knock-on effect by delaying the rest of their deadlines too", "3 Computer Remote Support  Over the past decade or so, the computer industry and companies operating in the field, have been able to move on  from traditional support services, due to advancements in Internet speeds and software", "Rather than just being on the  phone or on an internet chat with the user, Computer Remote Support now allows the supporter to remotely connect  to the user\u2019s computer and take direct control of it", "This means that the problem the user is having is now  contextualised for the supporter, he is able to see first-hand any error messages that occur and the chain of events  Document Revision Page  ABG3016-RP-171128 Released 7 of 12  Confidential", "\u00a9 2018 AMRC with Boeing", "Template \u2013 AMRC", "RP Revision 14 (June 2017)  that leads up to the messages or program crashes occurring", "The supporter is then able to analyse the user\u2019s  computer, look at and directly manipulate the system to attempt to solve the issue and all the while they can be  talking to the user, explaining what he\u2019s doing as he\u2019s doing it, which means that if the problem reoccurs in the future  the user would have a much better chance of solving it themselves", "This level of presence has benefitted the computer industry by being able to provide a more efficient and a more  precise way to help end users solve their problems and make much better use of expert\u2019s time by removing the need  to travel to each client individually", "Essentially, the direct control of the system alleviated most of the problems  associated with the remote aspect of the support", "The main focus of this work was to investigate whether or not it is  possible to bring this presence to physical products and processes, as being able to see, walk around and interact with  the problematic product would allow for an improved support service", "2 Previous Work  At time of writing, and to the best knowledge of the author, there have been two attempts at  trying to improve remote support services for physical products and processes", "One is an offering  from Microsoft integrated into their HoloLens device and the latter was work carried out as a part  of an doctorate engineering program between Rolls-Royce and the Nuclear AMRC", "1 Skype for HoloLens  With the release of Microsoft\u2019s Augmented Reality (AR) device, the HoloLens, a Cyber-Physical presence in a scenario  was now possible", "The software utilises the camera suite of the HoloLens to allow the supporter to virtually draw onto  user\u2019s view to show them what they need to do, whilst talking to the user to explain the tasks simultaneously", "While  enabling the supporter to see what the user sees using the camera of the HoloLens does provide an improvement to  the support service as it contextualises the problem for the supporter, is also somewhat limited", "A certain degree of  instructions between the user and the supporter is still required for the supporter to be able to see exactly what they  need to, interactions remain limited, the HoloLens is not widely available, the device is expensive at \u00a34529 for a  consumer model, and the program itself is not extendable in any way", "Figure 2-1 depicts an example scenario of the  software being used", "Here the supporter, in this case a father, is showing his daughter how to fit a U-bend", "Figure 2-1 Microsoft\u2019s Skype for HoloLens demonstration  Document Revision Page

doctorate program in 2016 at the Nuclear AMRC a Low Cost Remote Support system was  developed", "This system allowed a Bi-directional link to allow communication between a Manufacturing Cell and Virtual  Environment", "The system used a large frame to house an array of Microsoft Kinect sensors, to detect the location of  work inside the cell, and projectors to display work instructions and information on to a wing skin", "The Kinect sensors  were used to show the positon of the worker in the virtual environment, which could be viewed by a person in Virtual  Reality (VR) and he could then point virtual lasers at regions of interest (ROI) on the physical wing through the  projectors", "While this was a good  attempt and implementation to solve  the specific problem, it was also  limited in number of ways", "The frame  for the Kinect sensors and projectors  was large and heavy meaning it was  far from a mobile solution, it was a  bespoke solution to a particular  problem, it required a calibration  process and if it was to be extended  to a different scenario it would  require an entire virtual scene to be  created for that specific problem", "Figure 2-2 Frame and Wing Skin  3 Remote Support  For the Remote Support system implemented in this work, three salient qualities were identified  to ensure that it was an improvement over current attempts", "It then needed to be determined  what technologies allowed these aspects to be implemented into the system, and then the system  could be produced", "1 Defining the Three Salient Qualities   Firstly, and most importantly, this system needed to be general", "It was paramount that anyone could use this system  for any product or scenario", "This was one of the benefits of the HoloLens system and one of the drawbacks to the Low  Cost Remote Support solution", "Secondly, it needed to be a mobile solution so that support could provide on a wide  range of physical items and scenarios, for example underneath a car, looking at an entire plane wing or in tight and  confined spaces", "Lastly, the system needed to be accessible, so using devices that people are already familiar with and  not bespoke solutions to particular problems", "Generally speaking, when Remote Support is needed it is rarely going to  be in a pristine laboratory or factory, it would be needed at the inconvenient times and in the inconvenient places,  which was something that was attempted to be captured in these three qualities", "Document Revision Page  ABG3016-RP-171128 Released 9 of 12  Confidential", "\u00a9 2018 AMRC with Boeing", "Template \u2013 AMRC", "RP Revision 14 (June 2017)  3", "2 Solving the Three Salient Qualities  3", "1 General  To solve the generalisation problem, a VR scene needed to  be dynamically generated for a contextualised system", "To  be able to do this, a device needed to be used that allowed  a detailed 3D scan of the problematic physical asset to be  produced", "There are a number of different commercially  available products that would allow this to be performed,  from camera and depth sensor solutions such as the  Microsoft Kinect (1) and the HoloLens (2) to stereoscopic  cameras such as the Zed Space (3)", "The results from the  devices ranged from unusable such as one produced by the  HoloLens, to very good produced by the Kinect Sensor,  however due to mobility issues with the Kinect needing to  be power and a PC to be connected to it had to be ruled  out", "As the quality of the scan was so good, there was a  brief discussion about how to make the system mobile,  however then bespoke hardware would have been created  for the system which was something was to be specifically  avoided", "These device at least proved that it is possible to  produce a detailed 3D scan of a physical asset that could  then be used in a VR scene", "The main issue was the second  salient aspect, mobility", "2 Mobile  The solution needed to be mobile so that it could be taken and used in any given scenario, which would not have been  possible if the user was tethered to a PC, like when the Kinect was used", "The HoloLens is mobile device, however as  can be seen from Figure 3-1, which is a scan of a Caterham, the poor quality of the cameras meant that it was  unsuitable for the needs of this project", "A mobile device that is familiar to almost everyone and has recently become  capable of performing the tasks required in this system is the Smart Phone", "Since their inception in the early 1980s, mobile phones manufacturers have been driven by consumer demand for the  latest and greatest handsets", "This has forced the manufacturers to keep innovating and pushing the boundaries of  mobile technology, whether they are pushing for the highest resolution screen, fastest chipset, most powerful  graphical capabilities or unique features that make the devices stand out from the crowd", "These devices have also  become sensor rich with a plethora of different sensors integrated, meaning that a wealth of information is readily  available to be accessed by developers on these systems", "3 Accessible  For the final salient quality, Accessibility, was important because of the need to keep the system useable to as many  people as possible without needing special training, and it also needed to be not a bespoke solution or piece of  equipment for a particular problem", "With the sheer versatility demonstrated by smart phone app stores, it was clear  that Accessibility was also encapsulated in mobile phones", "As they are so prevalent in society, the vast majority of  people already know how to operate one and use Apps for them, so a mobile phone became the ideal platform to  develop the Remote Support system on", "Figure 3-1 HoloLens Scan  Figure 3-2 Kinect Scan  Document Revision Page  ABG3016-RP-171128 Released 10 of 12  Confidential", "\u00a9 2018 AMRC with Boeing", "Template \u2013 AMRC", "RP Revision 14 (June 2017)  3", "3 Mobile AR and VR   With so much data being produced by users and companies in today\u2019s civilization, one of the latest trends in the tech  sector is Data Visualisation", "Two of the relatively new and popular methods are AR and VR, while these have been  possible on specifically made devices such as the Google Glass, Microsoft HoloLens and the HTC Vive, for a few years,  only recently has it been possible to incorporate them onto mobile devices, due to advancements in mobile CPU and  GPU speeds and power", "1 Mobile AR  AR has, over the past year or two, become a major focus for the big hitters in the Mobile Phone sector", "Both Apple  and Google who together have over 99% of the mobile OS market share (1), have made firm statements about how  they view the importance of Augmented Reality in the near future, producing platforms such as ARkit and ARCore  respectively", "These software development kits are enabling developers to produce AR based apps for their devices", "Google have also been developing a much more powerful AR software development kit called Tango (5)", "Due to its  sophistication it does need a certain suite of sensors, specifically a Tri-Camera system that has a standard camera, one  dedicated to motion tracking and a depth sensor", "This enables the phone to perform fairly sophisticated and advanced  AR techniques such as Motion Tracking and Area Learning", "2 Mobile VR  Virtual Reality is also a focus for some mobile phone companies like Google and Samsung, producing the Cardboard  and Gear VR systems", "While this is taking a very simplistic approach to VR, it\u2019s also much more accessible than more  sophisticated fully fledged VR systems like the Oculus Rift (6) and the HTC Vive (7), with the aim of putting VR into the  hands of everybody", "The \u2018top-end\u2019 of the mobile VR market is the Daydream (6) system also produced by Google", "This  is an updated and refined version of their earlier Cardboard device", "It has a 6 DOF controller for interacting with and  moving around the virtual scene", "By simply inserting a mobile phone into the headset, the Daydream software is  launched and this allows the user to be in a VR environment", "Using the phones Inertial Measurement Unit, orientation  tracking is possible", "Phones that can be used in for Daydream applications must meet certain performance  requirements to ensure the apps will run on the phone, and this standardisation across hardware and software is  being driven by Google themselves", "It\u2019s also small, transportable and relatively low cost, satisfying the second and  third salient qualities discussed above", "4 Implementation of this Remote Support system  For this Remote Support application it was believed that AR was particularly applicable for the user who was onsite,  with the ASUS Zenfone AR (9) the user is able to walk around the problematic item, produce a detailed 3D coloured  scan of the object, place markers upon the scan at regions of interest, annotate the markers to explain what he thinks  the issue is and also take an image of the part, attaching it to the marker", "It was also thought that VR plays well to the  demands of the Remote support part of the system, being able to immerse themselves in a virtual world and see the  scanned object in a 1:1 scale", "The scanned mesh was uploaded to an FTP server which could then be downloaded to  supporter using the Daydream system", "He could then move around and look at the object in 360 degrees, view  markers placed by the supportee and place their own and add or edit annotations associated with each marker", "He  could also see the where the supportee is standing in relation to the object and, like the computer remote support  system mentioned earlier, talk the supportee through what he believes to be the issue is and the solution to the  problem", "The user in VR could also see the location of the AR user relative to the scanned object, and point at ROI  using a laser pointer which was visible through the AR user\u2019s phone", "Document Revision Page  ABG3016-RP-171128 Released 11 of 12  Confidential", "\u00a9 2018 AMRC with Boeing", "Template \u2013 AMRC", "RP Revision 14 (June 2017)  4 Conclusions and recommendations  4", "1 Benefits  Most prominently it is improving the quality of the remote support services that a company could provide, which  would result in an improved customer experience with the company", "It improves these services by providing a more  precise method to identify a problem, explain why it\u2019s wrong and provide solutions to it", "As the system is based off  using smart phones, which the vast majority of people already know how to use, no special training is required to use  the system whereas if it was Hololens and HTC Vive based, this may be a requirement", "It is far more cost effective  when compared to the original solution that was going to be implemented using the two aforementioned devices", "It is  a completely mobile solution so you don\u2019t need to be in an office or a VR space to provide the support, the supporter  could be anywhere so long as they had a reliable internet connection to their device", "It also means that the support  could be provided at any time too, so long as they have the device with them", "This system is also completely general,  so long as there is an item to scan, support could be provided for it", "2 Limitations  The scanning of objects was occasionally difficult, particularly on matte black objects like the tyre tread, the Asus  Zenfone AR does have a specialized tri camera system, however if the comments by Apple and Google (10) about AR  are taken to be as serious as they say, these types of camera systems will be essential to improving the quality of their  AR platforms in the future", "Daydream is also only available on Android devices however if Apple plan to support VR on  their phones in the future then cross platform operation should be feasible", "3 Future Work  Firstly, voice is currently transmitted through the standard cellular network capabilities of the mobile device", "Voice  calling can be integrated into the application using voice over IP (VOIP), providing greater control, allowing multiple  participants, and removing the reliance on a cellular network", "A log in system would also be able to record who the  supporter and supportee were, the time of the support session and the issues raised and fixed during the session  which could be recorded into a database for future reference and potentially data tracking and analysis of the system  for further improvements", "Additional attachments could be added to each marker, for example documentation  regarding the problematic part of the product", "3D Geometry of different items could be imported to show how the  product should look", "Freeform drawing could be implemented so either user could draw directly on the virtual object", "Reports could automatically be generated based on the session between the user and the supporter", "Multiple  Collaboration could be included so many people could enter the VR scene to collaborate and come up with solutions  to the problem", "Lastly, with Offline Capabilities could be used so neither party has to wait until the other is free for  support to be given", "Document Revision Page

presents an opportunity to reduce costs and increase product  quality through automation", "involves an operator inspecting a panel with a mobile device to click multiple images", "This is time consuming and prone to errors", "An inspection tool based on artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed to demonstrate the improvement in efficiency that can be achieved in the quality assurance

pins and other precast embeds respectively", "These results can be improved by stabilising the vision system and also training the models on data captured in the production environment", "Another test carried out on an actual  production panel for the Thames Tideway Blackfriars project at EIP resulted in the model being able to accurately detect 92% of the anchor pins", "This  particular  model  was trained on a very small  dataset  (66 images)  captured at  AMRC Factory 2050, and was trained using the previously trained anchor pin model for the ESJ project as a starting point", "Recommendations on how to improve the accuracy of the AI models by stabilising the vision system, using a higher resolution camera has been stated", "Additional features that can be added to the inspection tool to further enhance its capabilities such as the ability to detect embeds not visible to the overhead camera using a tablet device, checking the shape of the panel,  colour  coding  similar  looking  embeds  haves  also  been  discussed", "With  further development in training the AI models with the right data and improvement in the hardware, this tool can be deployed on the shop
